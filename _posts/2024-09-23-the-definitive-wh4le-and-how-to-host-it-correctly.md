# The Versions of WH4LE
## cooloblivion still exists
12-12-2023 & 12-13-2023: First WH4LE

12-14-2023: Add loading gif when you press the first button

12-16-2023: "The chromeos debug menu isn't compatible" replaced page and Google login as replacement of the standard input boxes (HUGE MISTAKE)

12-18-2023: reverted change & whale.mom flagged by safe browsing

12-20-2023: WhaleOS Release
## cooloblivion collapse AND WH4LE DOWNFALL
Somewhere around feburary-may: whale.mom dies (Parents found kilo's stack of stolen chromebooks), kelpseastem writable and kilo leaves, nuclearnatocat goes inactive, cooloblivion gives ownership to 0x90b1, she does absolutely nothing with the whale inc. server and now I'm unofficially managing it<br>
It would mean alot if 0x90b1 actually does something so whale inc. can be sort of active again, please invite your friends to wh4le: http://discord.gg/q9x4T6aDbT

Idk at this point: whale.x10.mx domain expires

8-25-2024: whale.x10.mx grabbed by me

8-30-2024: 12-18-2023 version of wh4le up but no file-download.html and not the original HTML

9-7-2024: Original 12-20-2023 version up without the banner, still no file-download.html

9-23-2024 (today): Loading.gif replaced (not the original one) and file-download.html found
# The Definitive WH4LE
What you see on whale.x10.mx now is the final WH4LE. Now let's host it.
# Requirements
* Know how to upload files to your hosting provider
* Not have view source and save page as blocked
Difficulty: Easy
# ACTUALLY DOING IT
View the page source for http://whale.x10.mx, copy all of it and save it to a file called index.html (don't use save page as)

VIew the page soruce for http://whale.x10.mx/file-download.html, copy all of it and save it to a file called file-download.html (don't use save page as)

Go to http://whale.x10.mx/favicon.png, press Ctrl+S to save it, keep it as favicon.png

Go to http://whale.x10.mx/loading.gif, press Ctrl+S to save it, keep it as loading.gif

Upload all the files you got to your website, YOU DID IT! It was that easy

## keep it like this
You can put wh4le in folders without breaking anything

I recommend to not make any changes as that'll bring more questions on what's the original website (whale.x10.mx)

whale.mom is probably not coming back anytime soon
